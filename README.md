# Privacy Sandbox Demo
This repository contains a demo of the Privacy Sandbox API. It is a simple web application that allows you to test the API in a browser.

1. First, you need to join an interest group. You can do this by visiting the cafe page or the travel page.

2. After visiting either one of the pages, you can visit the publisher website and see the related ad. The ad auction was executed on your device and the ad was rendered inside fenced frame tag. In this way, DSP won't be able to track you.
